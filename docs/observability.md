# Dualcut Observability & Operational Readiness

This document details the operational readiness, logging infrastructure, diagnostic signals, and observability guidelines for Dualcut (`org.tunaos.dualcut`).

## Executive Summary

- **Component Name**: Dualcut (`org.tunaos.dualcut`)
- **Architecture**: Rust-based GNOME video editor built with GTK4, Libadwaita, GStreamer Editing Services (GES), and Vello. Includes an embedded HTTP API server for agentic automation and script execution.
- **Maintenance Status**: Active (with development focus transitioning to `shrimply` for new features).
- **Distribution**: Flatpak (TunaOS OCI registry and direct releases).

## Telemetry & Data Policy

**No external telemetry backends are configured or authorized.** All application diagnostics and session logs remain strictly local. The system is designed with privacy-first observability:

- HTTP API is bound exclusively to `127.0.0.1` (localhost)
- No external metrics export or remote telemetry transmission
- GStreamer debug output stays on the local machine
- Project documents are never sent outside the local system

### Future Telemetry Considerations

Should an operational backend be designated in the future, the following architecture is recommended:

1. **OpenTelemetry Rust Tracing** (`tracing-opentelemetry`):
   - Instrument long-running tasks: project rendering, silence detection, script execution
   - Use bounded span attributes (project ID hashes, clip format, pipeline state transitions)
   - **Never** export raw user content or file paths

2. **Metrics Collection**:
   - Expose operational metrics (export duration, frames rendered, pipeline init latency) only via local, pull-based endpoints (e.g., `/metrics` on localhost)
   - Use standard event listeners where applicable

## Diagnostic Signal Sources

### Systemd Journal & Flatpak Logs

When running as a Flatpak, session logs flow through standard output/stderr to systemd journal:

```bash
# Stream live logs for Dualcut
journalctl --user -f -u org.tunaos.dualcut

# Retrieve recent error events (last hour)
journalctl --user-unit=org.tunaos.dualcut --since "1 hour ago" -p err
```

### GStreamer & GLib Debug Logging

GStreamer pipelines emit rich diagnostic channels via environment variables:

```bash
# Debug GStreamer Editing Services (GES) and video rendering
GST_DEBUG=2,ges:4,gespipeline:5 flatpak run org.tunaos.dualcut

# Trace GTK4 and GLib debug events
G_MESSAGES_DEBUG=all flatpak run org.tunaos.dualcut
```

Common `GST_DEBUG` levels: 0=none, 1=error, 2=warning, 3=fixme, 4=info, 5=debug, 6=log, 7=trace.

### HTTP Agent API Diagnostics

While the API server runs (default port 7357):
- Access logs and errors print to standard error
- Health check endpoint: `GET /status` verifies server responsiveness
- Project API: `GET /project` validates document structure

## Operational Health Verification

| Component | Health Signal | Verification |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| **Flatpak Launch** | GTK window initialization | `flatpak run org.tunaos.dualcut --version` |
| **GStreamer Pipeline** | GES element availability | `gst-inspect-1.0 ges` |
| **Rendering** | Encoder plugins (H.264, VP8) | `gst-inspect-1.0 -k h264` `gst-inspect-1.0 -k vp8` |
| **HTTP API** | Local server response | `curl http://localhost:7357/status` (while serving) |
| **Project Validation** | JSON schema compliance | `python3 -c "import json; json.load(open('project.json'))"` |

## Operations Troubleshooting

### GStreamer Pipeline Issues

Use environment variable debugging to isolate media encoding/decoding problems:

```bash
# Enable all GStreamer debugging
GST_DEBUG=*:5 flatpak run org.tunaos.dualcut 2>&1 | grep -i error

# Check specific element availability
gst-inspect-1.0 | grep -E 'h264|vp8|aac|vorbis'
```

### Proxy Media Cache

Proxy media is cached in `.dualcut-cache/` within the project directory:
- Safe to delete; will be regenerated on next preview
- Reduces timeline scrubbing latency for large videos
- Disable with *Preferences → Use proxy media*

### Deprecation Guidance

Critical security and crash fixes are maintained in Dualcut. For new features, evaluate against [shrimply](https://github.com/soirihiroka/shrimply) — the active development project.
